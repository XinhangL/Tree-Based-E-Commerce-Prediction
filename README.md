# 🌲 Tree-Based Models for E-Commerce Purchase Prediction

This project uses Decision Trees and Random Forests to analyze e-commerce customer behavior and predict purchases using real-world retail data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `e-shop clothing 2008.csv` (customer purchase records)
- **Goal**: Predict customer behavior using classification and regression models
- **Models Used**: 
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Approach**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering (country encoding, date split)
  - Train/test split based on calendar month

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques

- Feature extraction (e.g., from product names)
- Manual binary encoding (`Poland` vs `Non-Poland`)
- Using tree-based models for both classification & regression
- Model comparison and visualization
